## Why another Web Builder?

* [AmadeusWeb Builder v9.3.1](https://github.com/amadeus-web-world/spring) is a file based offline website builder.
* Its set to counter the current [pitiful internet state](https://amadeusweb.world/imran/2025-10/01-to-05/#utm) with an alternative - an [internet of missions](https://amadeusweb.world/imran/the-year-2025/?keyword=mission).
* As part of [DAWN](https://amadeusweb.world/#utm) it has a simple deliberate signup progression (see masthead of root or AW Domains).
* In Dec 2025, it was fronted by now [AW Oases](https://amadeusweb.world/oases/#utm).
* It is now a part of the [work signup process](https://amadeusweb.world/work/signup/#utm).
* It is fronted by Imran Ali Namazi - creator and [Sovreign Builder](https://amadeusweb.world/imran/?sitemap=1#utm)

## The Way we engage

Before using it, take some time to:

* understand it's [rationale and wilful restrictions](https://amadeusweb.world/spring/license/#utm).
* ponder its long term ramifications, and what it would mean for you.
* think what the courtesies / whois can do for your entire network / ecosystems / future.
* Then make a `token of goodwill` and wait for our acceptance before proceeding with the steps below.
