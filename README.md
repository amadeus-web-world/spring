## The Way we engage

Before using it, take some time to:

* understand it's [rationale and wilful restrictions](https://github.com/amadeus-web-world/spring#License-1-ov-file).
* ponder its long term ramifications, and what it would mean for you.
* think what the courtesies / whois can do for your entire network / ecosystems / future.
* Then make a `token of goodwill` and wait for our acceptance before proceeding with the steps below.

## Setup

1. Create a folder -- `D:\AmadeusWeb\alliances`
2. If already a dawn folder exists, either rename it or remove the md (make dir) from the batch file.
3. copy the "setup-dawn.bat" into the `alliances` folder and run it
4. visit `http://spring.amadeusweb.world/setup/` for the rest of the setup process
