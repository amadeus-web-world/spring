## Why This Framework

* The "**Dynamic Amadeus Web Network**, is intended to be a model of an **Internet of Missions** with **Action Oriented Projects** spanning people, organizations and movements.
* It is powered by [Amadeus Web Builder version 9](https://github.com/amadeus-web-world/spring) -- the **dawn/spring** codebase.
* It has been under development by [Imran Ali Namazi](https://imran.amadeusweb.world/) since 2019
	* and is the culmination of his web/file based apps & systems especially since:
		* 2000 &mdash; vb6 folder nav / file viewer
		* 2005 &mdash; html hand coding
		* 2011 &mdash; biblios and MVC
		* 2019 &mdash; Amadeus 1.0
		* 2025 &mdash; Amadeus 9.0
* It is uniquely poised to:
	* dislolodge the current **Internet of Vice**.
	* aid the grand **BUILDERS** and would be **STEWARDS** of this earth.
	* create an **OASIS within the internet** which is intent driven and progressive.
